    "For this problem, you will implement a variation of the classic word game Hangman. In this problem, the second player will always be the computer, who will be picking a word at random. In this problem, you will implement a function, called hangman, that will start up and carry out an interactive Hangman game between a player and the computer. Before we get to this function, we'll first implement a few helper functions to get you going.\n",

    "    3. If the user guesses the same letter twice, do not take away a guess - instead, print a message letting them know they've already guessed that letter and ask them to try again.\n",
    "    4. The game should end when the user constructs the full word or runs out of guesses. If the player runs out of guesses (s/he \"loses\"), reveal the word to the user when the game ends."
